// The primary mouse button's dedupe. Android reports the primary button twice per
// transition — as `Down`/`Up` (the finger-like pair) and as `ButtonPress`/`ButtonRelease`
// (the button pair) — so one physical click would reach the app as two, and a
// double-click as four. `Reported` collapses each transition to one report.
//
// This file is included verbatim by the wordcraft workspace's tests
// (`crates/ui-egui/tests/android_primary_button.rs`), so it uses only `std` and
// plain comments where a module's `//!` would not survive the include.
